# Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz

# Polymorphism

1. What does the ___word___ 'polymorphism' mean?

 - Polymorphism literally means something can have many forms.

2. What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.

 - In 'OO' design the application of polymorphism allows us to treat a class as a different class or type and means we can stick to SOLID principles making our code more extensible.

3. What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?

 - We can implement polymorphism in Java through the use of Abstract classes and Interfaces.

4. How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?

 - We can treat an instance of a class as if it is another two forms; a new class or a new type at the same time.

5. Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.

 - We could create an abstract class. A superclass which all the classes we want to treat as being the same can inherit methods from.



# Composition

6. What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?

 - Composition refers to a HAS-A relationship where an object is made up of one or more other objects.

7. When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.

 - We can use composition in cases where one object "has" (or is part of) another object.

8. What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?

- Composition allows a class to use behaviour from a group of other classes, and makes it possible for that behaviour to change at runtime.

9. When an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?

 - If the composite object is destroyed, all the component parts must be destroyed. The part has no life of itself and cannot be transferred to another object.
